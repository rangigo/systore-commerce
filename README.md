## Troubleshoot

<details>
<summary>I already own a BigCommerce store. What should I do?</summary>
<br>
First thing you do is: <b>set your environment variables</b>
<br>
<br>
.env.local

```sh
BIGCOMMERCE_STOREFRONT_API_URL=<>
BIGCOMMERCE_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN=<>
BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_URL=<>
BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_TOKEN=<>
BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_CLIENT_ID=<>
```

If your project was started with a "Deploy with Vercel" button, you can use Vercel's CLI to retrieve these credentials.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and Github accounts (creates .vercel file): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull .env.local`

Next, you're free to customize the starter. More updates coming soon. Stay tuned.
